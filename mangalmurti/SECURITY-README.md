# Security Improvements

## What Has Been Done

### 1. ✅ Obfuscated Admin Passcode
- **Before**: Passcode `373679` was visible in plain text in `app.js`
- **After**: 
  - Passcode is now base64 encoded and stored as `_pc`
  - Verification uses hash comparison instead of direct string comparison
  - Harder to find by casual inspection of code
  - **Note**: Still can be decoded by determined attackers, but provides basic protection

### 2. ✅ Encoded Firebase Configuration
- **Before**: Firebase API keys were in plain text in `firebase-init.js`
- **After**:
  - Firebase config moved to `config.js` and base64 encoded
  - Decoded only when needed at runtime
  - Slight obfuscation to prevent easy harvesting by bots
  - **Note**: Still visible if someone decodes it, but provides basic protection

### 3. ✅ Firebase Security Rules (You Added)
- Protects your Firebase database from unauthorized access
- Even if someone gets your API key, they can't access data without proper authentication

## Security Level

**Current Security: MODERATE** ⚠️
- ✅ Good for internal/private deployment (local network, trusted devices)
- ✅ Firebase rules protect against unauthorized database access
- ⚠️ API keys and passcode can still be decoded by tech-savvy users
- ❌ Not recommended for fully public deployment without additional security

## For Production Deployment

If you want to deploy this publicly, consider these additional improvements:

### Option 1: Keep Current Setup (For Internal Use)
**Best for**: Small business, local network, trusted users
- Current security is adequate
- Make sure to:
  - Deploy only on HTTPS
  - Restrict Firebase to specific domains in Firebase Console
  - Change admin passcode periodically

### Option 2: Enhanced Security (For Public Use)
**Best for**: Public website, untrusted users
- Implement Firebase Authentication (email/password or Google sign-in)
- Use Firebase App Check to restrict API access
- Move sensitive operations to Firebase Cloud Functions
- Implement proper user roles and permissions

## Admin Passcode

**Current Passcode**: `373679`

The passcode is still `373679` but now it's:
- Base64 encoded as `MzczNjc5`
- Verified using hash comparison
- Harder to find in browser dev tools

**To change the passcode:**
1. Open `app.js`
2. Find line with `this._pc = this._d('MzczNjc5')`
3. Encode your new passcode in base64:
   - Go to: https://www.base64encode.org/
   - Enter your new passcode (e.g., `123456`)
   - Copy the base64 result (e.g., `MTIzNDU2`)
   - Replace `MzczNjc5` with your new encoded passcode

## Firebase Configuration

Your Firebase config is now in `config.js` and encoded.

**To update Firebase config:**
1. Get your Firebase config object
2. Convert it to JSON string
3. Base64 encode it at: https://www.base64encode.org/
4. Replace the `_encoded` value in `config.js`

Example:
```javascript
// Original config
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "authDomain": "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
  // ... other fields
}

// Convert to base64 and replace _encoded value in config.js
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Limitations of Client-Side Security:**
- Any JavaScript code running in the browser can be inspected
- Obfuscation is NOT encryption - it just makes it harder to read
- For true security, sensitive operations should be on a backend server
- Firebase Security Rules are your primary protection

✅ **What Protects You:**
- Firebase Security Rules (most important!)
- HTTPS encryption in transit
- Obfuscation as deterrent against casual inspection

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Verify Firebase Security Rules are active
- [ ] Test admin login with obfuscated passcode
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enabled (if hosting online)
- [ ] Restrict Firebase to your domain in Firebase Console
- [ ] Test catalog sync from multiple devices
- [ ] Backup your data regularly
